/**
 * The public catalogue, derived from the programme definition.
 *
 * This used to be a second hand-written list, and it cost something real. Two
 * courses in a row were added to the programme and forgotten here — so the
 * academy would not have listed the orientation every volunteer must take
 * first, nor the challenge that opens level 2. The probe caught both, which is
 * the only reason they were not live errors. A rule that depends on somebody
 * remembering is a rule that breaks on the thirtieth course, and there are
 * thirty-four still to write.
 *
 * So this file no longer decides what exists. It decides only how the public
 * pages present what the programme already defines: which shelf a course sits
 * on, and who it was written for. Title, summary, minutes, difficulty,
 * prerequisites and icon now come from one place.
 *
 * Adding a course is one entry in programme/definition.ts. A course with no
 * line below still appears — filed under a default category with no audience
 * section — rather than vanishing.
